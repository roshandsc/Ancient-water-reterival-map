# Traditional Water Conservation Systems of India (GeoJSON Dataset)

This project visualizes traditional water conservation systems across India using the [GeoJSON](https://geojson.org/) format. It features historically significant and ecologically impactful water harvesting structures like **Stepwells, Johads, Zabo Systems, Karez**, and many more.

## üåç Project Objective

To digitally document and share the geographical distribution and contextual information about India's ancient and region-specific water conservation methods using open geospatial data formats. This can help raise awareness, assist researchers, and support water sustainability efforts.

## üß≠ Dataset Description

Each entry in the dataset includes:
- **Type** of water system (e.g., Stepwell, Karez System)
- **Geographical location** (latitude & longitude)
- **Region**
- **Water harvesting principle**
- **Cultural and environmental reasons for usage**
- **Advantages**
- **Revival efforts**
- **Government initiatives**
- **Contributor name**
- **Images**
- **Other contextual details**

The data is stored in a standard **GeoJSON `FeatureCollection`** format.
